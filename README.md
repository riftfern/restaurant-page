# Restaurant Page 
    This is a simply designed restaurant website with a home, menu, and contact pages.  The goal of the this project was to get comfortable using Webpack, and to practice a modular design pattern using the basics of object oriented programming.  This project also uses minimal global code, and most of the html is created and manuliplated with JavaScript.
